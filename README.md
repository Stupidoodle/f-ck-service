# License

The code is licensed under the Affero General Public License (AGPL). This means that you are free to use the code for any purpose, but you cannot sell it or use it to make money. If you modify the code, you must also make your modifications available under the AGPL.

# Why the AGPL?

We chose the AGPL license because we want to ensure that the code is always available for free and that anyone can use it to improve customer service. We believe that the AGPL is the best way to ensure that the code is used for good and not for profit.

# Example (Google Bard Simulation)
```
Sure, I can simulate your code with the website https://www.vapiano.de/de/. Here is the output of the code:

prompt: "What is the website about?"
completion: "This website is about Vapiano, a German restaurant chain that specializes in fresh pasta, pizza, and salads. The website provides information about the restaurants, menus, and locations in Germany. It also allows customers to make reservations and order online."

The code first crawls the website and extracts the text content of all the articles on the website. The text content is then used to train the ChatGPT model. The ChatGPT model is then used to generate a response to the prompt "What is the website about?" The response is the text that you see above.

I hope this helps!

```
Sure, here is the output of the code with the prompt "What is PINSA PICCOLA":

prompt: "What is PINSA PICCOLA"
completion: "PINSA PICCOLA is a type of pizza that originated in Rome, Italy. It is made with a thicker crust than traditional pizza, and it is often topped with a variety of ingredients, such as tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and vegetables. PINSA PICCOLA is a healthier alternative to traditional pizza, as it is lower in calories and fat. It is also a good source of fiber and protein. PINSA PICCOLA is a popular dish in Italy, and it is becoming increasingly popular in other parts of the world."

The code first crawls the website and extracts the text content of all the articles on the website. The text content is then used to train the ChatGPT model. The ChatGPT model is then used to generate a response to the prompt "What is PINSA PICCOLA?" The response is the text that you see above.

I hope this helps!
